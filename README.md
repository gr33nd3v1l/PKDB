 http://twitch.tv/gr33nd3v1l - The stream where the pokémon are born when you request them and sent to you for free!
 
 My pokémon will always, when able, come with OT: SATAN, TID: 06660, T7ID: 006660

[Pokemon detail list is on Wiki](https://github.com/gr33nd3v1l/PKDB/wiki)

When requesting try to use pokemon showdown format! http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder

Use !pkm, !gts, !details, !help. 
Pokémon change every day at end of !dailypoll (usually noon my time), unless otherwise specified. 
I try to stick to the !dailypoll timer. Clock and more info is on screen, read it. ♥

The giveaway pokémon are always 91-100 unless they can evolve, or absolutely have to be lower. 
Keep in mind you don't have to level lock, or nickname the pokémon.

Deposit NOSEPASS or KOMALA in GTS asking for any of the giveaway !pokémon, you can visit the !details wiki for more info. You can track the trades live on cam, Sun are Nosepass trades, and Moon are Komala.

Current, Suggested, Tomorrow and TODO lists, and pokemon details can be found here: http://bit.ly/greenieGIT 
- Submit new ideas under Issues tab, more details in Wiki, Ctrl+F is your friend!

_SONGS_
You can request songs with !sr KEYWORDS OF SONG (e.g. !sr eminem lose yourself)
It costs 200 spots to request a song for a regular user! If it doesn't work, you probably don't have enough.
You can skip unwanted songs with !skipsong - it takes three votes to skip, or !skipsong 250 to pay.

# RULES

I only ask of you that if you use any of my files from this repository, you give me proper credit. These pokémon were created and collected by me. It's a lot of hard work, so the least you can do is just give me a proper mention ❤
